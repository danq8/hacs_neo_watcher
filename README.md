# Near Earth Object Watcher
**A custom component for Home Assistant that retrieves NEO data from NASA.**

NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) program focuses on detecting, tracking, and characterizing potentially hazardous asteroids and comets that could approach Earth, with the goal of understanding and mitigating potential risks.
They watch so you don't have to worry.

I created this Home Assistant integration for two reasons

- Because NASA has made this information public
  I had been searching for public API's with interesting information that I could display on HA.
  I wanted to learn more about what it takes to create an integration and expose entities with attributes.

- Because the NEO project is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity.
  It's a reminder that science is not just a subject in school; it's a powerful tool for understanding and safeguarding our world.
  The more we know, the less we have to fear, and the more we can appreciate the incredible universe we live in.
  This component is meant for people who are curious to know how often large, potentially dangerous objects pass us by on a monthly basis.
  If you're looking for an early warning system, the NASA website and the mainstream news organisations will have the information before it's shown here, sorry.

# Installation

I plan to submit this repository to the folks at HACS (https://hacs.xyz/).
In the meantime you can install this component by going to the HACS menu, clicking the three dots in the top right of the screen, selecting "Custom repositories" and adding https://github.com/danq8/hacs_neo_watcher as a repository, then selecting Type = Integration.
